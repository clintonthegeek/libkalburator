# Campaign FINDINGS — canon-upgrade / convergence

Two sections:
- **Open issues / watch items** — things discovered that a future task must handle.
  When you resolve one, note the commit and move it to "Resolved."
- **Discipline Log** — one-line smell reports per invariant 9. `file:line` + invariant
  number + one phrase. No fix required in the session you log it.

Append, don't rewrite. New issues from any task go here, even off-topic.

## Open issues / watch items

### O1 — `LossProfile` is surfaced to the engine layer
`tests/engine/tst_engine_unified_routing.cpp:383` reads `lastLossProfile().level`, and
`tests/engine/tst_carddav_engine_integration.cpp` imports `LossLevel`. Plan 1 Task 2
migrates these to the kinds API. **Watch:** if a stub host or engine code (not just
tests) exposes `LossProfile::level`/`.dropped`, Task 2's full build will name it — fix
with the documented substitutions, don't reintroduce the old fields. (Seeded 2026-05-23.)

### O2 — Carry-verbatim containers not yet field-specified
The non-isomorphic structures (event `RANGE=THISANDFUTURE`; todo hierarchy:
`relatedTo` tree / `parentUid` / `checklistItems`) are decided in principle (schema
§2, §4) but their exact JSON shape and differ/merger handling land in **Plan 3**.
Invariant P4 applies: specify the carrier before diffing it. (Seeded 2026-05-23.)

### O3 — Live API validation deferred, not done
The vendor-shapes reference (`docs/2026-05-23-vendor-api-shapes-reference.md`) is from
docs + MS open specs, not live calls. Edge cases (real recurrence payloads, IANA↔Windows
mappings, Graph immutable-id behavior) should be validated with live Google/Graph calls
**during Plan 3** when the concrete (de)serialization stages are written. Not a blocker
for Plans 1–2. (Seeded 2026-05-23.)

### O4 — WildPalms port is downstream, but its invariants are upstream
WildPalms moves its conduits onto the converged pipeline **after this branch merges**
(handoff §3, §7). We do not wire WildPalms. But the five WildPalms invariants
(invariant 10) must hold throughout — especially that the loss model can express
`Reversible` (X-property round-trip) before Plan 3 writes the palm/canon edges. (Seeded 2026-05-23.)

### O5 — `pipeline.cpp` loss folding assumed clean
Planning grep found no `.level`/`.dropped` usage in `src/shape/pipeline.cpp`, so
`composedLoss()` should fold via `compose()` unchanged. **Watch:** confirm during Plan 1
Task 2's full build; if `composedLoss()` references the removed fields, update it the
same way. (Seeded 2026-05-23.)

### O6 — design §8 was imprecise; corrected when Plan 2 was designed
The §8 planning stub said **two** `Shape::` singletons remain (`TransformationRegistry`,
`DomainRegistry`) and that they would be "owned by the `SyncEngine`." Reading the landed call sites
showed **three** (the engine also reads `DomainOperationsRegistry` at `syncengine.cpp:1874`,`:2423`;
~40 tests `clear()` it), and that engine-ownership is wrong because `PluginManager` is an independent
*writer* of the same registries. §8 was rewritten (2026-05-24) to the resolved topology — an injected
`ShapeRegistries` bundle owned at the composition root, shared by reference with both PluginManager
(writer) and SyncEngine (reader), the OSGi `BundleContext` model. Recorded as a documented deviation
from the stub per the INVARIANTS deviation rule. (Seeded 2026-05-24, Plan 2 design.)

### O7 — Ambient-Context default bundle must be removed after downstream ports
Plan 2 keeps a process-global `defaultShapeRegistries()` and `::instance()` accessors that delegate
to it, purely so PlanStan/WildPalms keep compiling against the current `SyncEngine`/`PluginManager`
ctors (invariant 10). This is Seemann's **Ambient Context anti-pattern**, legitimate **only as
removable scaffolding**. **Watch:** once PlanStan and WildPalms adopt the injecting ctor (downstream-
port work, after this branch merges — see O4), delete `defaultShapeRegistries()` and the three
`::instance()` accessors so the only construction site is the composition root. Not Plan 2's job;
Plan 2 lands the seam green. (Seeded 2026-05-24, Plan 2 design.)

### O8 — Plan-3/Plan-4 boundary: calendar canon moved into Plan 3 (scope decision)
Design §10's file-change list placed "`calendarstockshapes.cpp`: add canon + `ical↔canon`
bridges" under the **Plan 4** (convergence) work, while the STATUS Plan-3 row named
`calendar+canon` as Plan-3 scope — two sources of truth disagreeing (inv 7). Surfaced while
writing Plan 3 (2026-05-24). **Decision (human, 2026-05-24):** land all three canons —
including `calendar+canon` and its `ical↔canon` bridges — in **Plan 3**; narrow **Plan 4** to
pure convergence (retire `src/transcoding/`, RRULE-as-edge, remove `ApplyContext.transcodingPlan`
+ `CalendarPluginWriter` special-casing). Safe because the engine reads canonical from
`DomainDefinition::canonicalShape()` (not the graph) and transcoding is dormant in the default
build (empty plans; `RRuleTranscoder` only fires for `orgmode` backends, not built when
`KALBURATOR_HAVE_ORG_IO=OFF`). Plan 3 Task 13 records the same in STATUS on completion.
(Seeded 2026-05-24, Plan 3 authoring.)

## Resolved

### O1 — `LossProfile` engine-layer migration (resolved Plan 1 Task 2, 2026-05-23)
`tst_engine_unified_routing.cpp` and `tst_carddav_engine_integration.cpp` were migrated
to `isLossless()` / `droppedProperties()` in Task 2. Full build confirmed no remaining
`LossLevel`/`.level`/`.dropped` references in production or test code.

### O5 — `pipeline.cpp` loss folding (resolved Plan 1 Task 2, 2026-05-23)
`composedLoss()` in `src/shape/pipeline.cpp` uses only `compose()` — no direct field
access — so it compiled cleanly without changes. Confirmed by Task 2's full build.
